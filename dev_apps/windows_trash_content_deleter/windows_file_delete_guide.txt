 Here's a Windows-compatible Python script that:

    Scans the Recycle Bin

    Flags suspicious files by extension (e.g., .exe, .bat, .scr, .vbs)

    Lists non-suspicious files too

    Prompts you to securely delete or keep each non-suspicious file

    Uses secure deletion via sdelete (Microsoft Sysinternals tool)

🪟 Secure Recycle Bin Cleaner for Windows (Python)

    ⚠️ Before running:

        Download sdelete64.exe from Microsoft Sysinternals:
        👉 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete

        Place it in the same folder as this script, or ensure it's on your PATH.
Requirements

Install winshell (only needed once):

pip install winshell

✅ Output Example

🔍 Scanning Recycle Bin...

📁 Found: C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21...\test.exe
⚠️ SUSPICIOUS file detected!

📁 Found: C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21...\old_report.docx
🗑️ Do you want to securely delete this file? (y/n):


Securely deleting a file that has no special attributes is relatively straight-forward:
 the secure delete program simply overwrites the file with the secure delete pattern.
 What is more tricky is securely deleting Windows NT/2K compressed, encrypted and sparse files,
 and securely cleansing disk free spaces.
