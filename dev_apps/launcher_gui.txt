We are creating a Launcher Script

This script lets the user select which tool to run:

    User Account Checker

    PII Checker etc

This launcher named launcher_gui.py is a Launcher GUI that lets you run multiple .exe apps such as users_permission_checker.exe 
and gives you buttons to launch each .exe.

However PLEASE NOTE that you MUST CONVERT all or any of the .py scripts to .EXE using PyInstaller, before using this launcher
In Terminal (see an example of what to do for each python script):

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole users_permission_checker.py

💡 The --noconsole makes it behave like a desktop app (GUI only).
The .exe files will be inside dist/ folder after build.

Also note that you do not lose your .py file.
When you convert a Python script (.py) to a Windows executable (.exe) using a tool like PyInstaller, it creates a copy in .exe format. Your original .py file remains intact and untouched.
🔁 How do you update the .exe if you later modify the .py file?

If you make any changes to the .py file, your .exe file doesn't update automatically.
To reflect your changes in the .exe:
✅ Steps to update your .exe:

    Make your changes in your original .py file.

    Rebuild the .exe using PyInstaller or whichever tool you originally used.

Example command:

pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py

pyinstaller --onefile users_permission_checker.py

This command will:

    Read your updated Python file.

    Regenerate a new .exe file inside the /dist folder.

    You can now replace the old .exe with the new one.


let’s walk through how to use your launcher_gui.exe to run other dev apps (like List_users_gui.exe or user_account_checker_extended.exe).
🧭 Overview

The launcher_gui.exe is a graphical launcher — like a home screen that helps you open your tools with a button click.

When you double-click on launcher_gui.exe, it shows you a simple interface with buttons like:

    ✅ Launch User Checker

    ✅ Launch List Users Tool

    ❌ Launch Something Else (if missing)

Each button is hardcoded to execute a specific .exe file located in the same folder.
✅ Step-by-Step Demonstration

Let’s assume you now have:

    launcher_gui.exe

    users_permission_checker.exe

    List_users_gui.exe

All inside the same folder, e.g.:

C:\MyTools\
 ├── launcher_gui.exe
 ├── users_permission_checker.exe
 └── List_users_gui.exe

🖱️ Step 1: Double-click launcher_gui.exe

A GUI window opens that says:

🔘 Launch User Checker
🔘 Launch List Users Tool

Final Packaging of Launcher GUI

Convert it to .exe with:

pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole launcher_gui.py

Your launcher is now a simple GUI app that lets you launch any of our .exe files newly deposited in a folder named "dist"

our script named rebuild_exe_launcher.py is a simple script created to rebuild all .exe files from their .py sources when needed.
