Python Encryption Tool for PII

This script encrypts sensitive data (e.g., names, phone numbers) using Fernet encryption.
📂 File: encrypting_pii.py
✅ Examples of How to Run It:
🔹 Example 1: Encrypt and Save to File

python encrypting_pii.py --encrypt "John Doe, +2348012345678" --outfile encrypted_data.txt

✔️ This encrypts the string and saves it in encrypted_data.txt.
🔹 Example 2: Decrypt from File

python encrypting_pii.py --decrypt-from encrypted_data.txt

✔️ This decrypts and displays the content previously saved.
🔹 Example 3: Generate a New Encryption Key

python encrypting_pii.py --generate-key

✔️ Creates a .key file that stores your encryption key securely.
Purpose:
Secure sensitive user data like emails, passwords, or phone numbers using symmetric encryption.

How to Use:

    Run the script in a Python environment with cryptography installed (pip install cryptography).

    Replace "user@example.com" with any sensitive string you want to encrypt.

    Store the key securely—without it, you can't decrypt the data.

Expected Output:
You’ll see:

Original Data: user@example.com
Encrypted: b'gAAAAAB...'
Decrypted: user@example.com

Success Indicator: The decrypted value matches the original.
