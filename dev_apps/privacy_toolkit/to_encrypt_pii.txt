Python Encryption Tool for PII

This script encrypts sensitive data (e.g., names, phone numbers) using Fernet encryption.
STEP 1: Document the Raw PII in a File

You create and update a file like plaintext_data.txt:

John Doe, +2348012345678, No. 5 Alpha Street, Lagos
Ngozi Uzochi, +2348076543210, No. 7 Beta Road, Abuja

This is your ongoing documentation. You keep adding to this file.

🛠 How to Use It (Scenarios)
🔹 1. Generate the Key

Only done once:

python encrypting_pii.py --generate-key

🔒 This creates pii_access.key.
🔹 2. Add Info to Your Plaintext File (Shared by All)

E.g., plaintext_data.txt:

Mr. John Doe, +2348012345678, 123 Main Street, Owerri
Mrs. Ngozi Uzochi, +2348023456789, 45 Uzo Avenue, Enugu

🔹 3. Encrypt the Whole File

python encrypting_pii.py --encrypt-file plaintext_data.txt --outfile encrypted_data.txt

🔐 Now encrypted_data.txt contains the encrypted info.
🔹 4. Decrypt When Needed

If pii_access.key is present:

python encrypting_pii.py --decrypt-from encrypted_data.txt

If pii_access.key is missing, the script will ask:

[?] Paste your decryption key:

🔑 User pastes the content of the key from a secure note or password manager.
🧩 Practical Setup with the Three Staff

Assume:

    Only one company PC holds the plaintext_data.txt file.

    All three staff need to access encrypted_data.txt, which is backed up or shared (e.g., via cloud or flash drive).

    The key file pii_access.key is never emailed or stored openly.

🔐 Key Distribution

    When the key is generated, copy its content (base64 string like b'GsZ...==')

    Securely share this key only once with each staff via:

        A hardware password manager (e.g., KeePass, Bitwarden)

        Handwriting the key and storing it in a locked cabinet

        Flash drive or QR code transferred under supervision

🔐 Key Storage Options for Staff

Each staff can:

    Save it in a secure password vault

    Paste it manually when prompted (if pii_access.key is missing)

    Store it on a company USB key that they plug into the hub PC when needed

✅ Summary: Phases and Security
Phase	What Happens
🔑 Key Generation	pii_access.key created; copied to 3 staff securely
📄 Info Documentation	Data written or appended to plaintext_data.txt (kept safe on hub PC)
🔐 Encryption Process	Entire file encrypted with --encrypt-file
🔁 Decryption	Requires the key file OR key pasted manually at prompt
🧑‍💼 Staff Access Control	Each staff must possess the key to view data; PC enforces no plaintext access
