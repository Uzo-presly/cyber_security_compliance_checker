DeprecationWarning: 'spwd' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.13
The script named users_permission_checker.txt, does not use spwd, and still checks for:

    Username

    UID filtering (to separate system vs real users)

    Home director
It also uses Tkinter for a graphical interface; an ideal functionality into the GUI rather than just print to the terminal.

Here’s how we have incorporated it:

    Has a button labeled “Check Folder Permissions”.

    When clicked, it will analyze access modes and show the result inside the same output box.

Displays UID and creation timestamp.


Results from permission checks are shown inside the same scrollable output window.
