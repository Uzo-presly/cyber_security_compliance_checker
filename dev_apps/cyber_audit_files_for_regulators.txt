While we selective_pii_code_checker_report.py script for general Personal Identifiable Information (PII) check, what we have here is
 greater!In that we are building a regulatory audit tool for cybersecurity compliance using actual framework documents (HIPAA, NDPR, NIST, and GDPR). Below is a working Python script that:

    Reads predefined keywords from the downloaded documents (which you've listed).

    Scans selected company files for violations of those keywords.

    Uses a clean folder structure for maintainability.

    Can be run from the command line.

‚úÖ 1. Folder Structure

3. How to Run It

Open your terminal and navigate into the dev_apps/ directory:

cd ~/protectedVault/mountpoint/cyber_security_compliance_checker/dev_apps

Now run the script:

python cyber_audit_runner.py --target ../../company_docs --framework NDPR
python cyber_audit_runner.py --target  ~/protectedVault/mountpoint/cyber_security_compliance_checker/example_company_papers/example_company_policies/sample_policy_gdpr.txt --framework NDPR

Replace NDPR with any of: HIPAA, GDPR, NIST
üìù Notes

    The keyword extraction avoids short common words (filters out anything less than 5 characters).

    PDF keyword extraction uses PyPDF2. You can install it with:

pip install PyPDF2

    Add more intelligence later (e.g., categorize keywords, use AI/LLM for smarter violation detection).

-------------------------PLEASE NOTE------------------
 
It is very essential that one understands data privacy compliance and how companies should handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII) responsibly. Let‚Äôs break it down into two parts:
üîç 1. If PII is found in finance_report.txt, what went wrong?

If a finance report like finance_report.txt contains direct PII (e.g., someone's full name and phone number), it may violate regulations like NDPR, GDPR, or HIPAA ‚Äî unless that data is there for a justified, documented reason, and is properly protected.
üîí How the details should have been handled:

    Redact or mask PII from documents that don‚Äôt absolutely need it.

        Example:
        Instead of: Name: John Doe, Phone: 0803-123-4567
        Use: Name: J*** D**, Phone: 0803-***-4567 or Client ID: 0145

    Anonymize or pseudonymize data for internal reports.

        Use codes or IDs to represent real people.

        Link those codes to real identities only in a separate, secure location.

üóÇÔ∏è 2. Where should names, phone numbers, and other PII be stored in an organization?
‚úÖ Approved places for storing PII:
Document Type	Who It's About	Where It Belongs	Access Level
Client Registration Forms	Customers / Clients	Stored securely in databases or encrypted files	Authorized customer service staff
Patient Medical Records	Patients	Encrypted EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems	Medical staff only
Employee Records	Staff / Contractors	HR department systems, HRIS	HR & authorized managers
Audit Logs / CRM systems	Clients & staff	Proper CRM / ERP tools with audit controls	Logged, restricted
Consent Forms	Anyone giving data	Secure document repository with version control	Data protection officer (DPO), auditors
‚ö†Ô∏è Files like finance_report.txt or budget_summary.csv should NEVER contain PII like:

    Full names

    Contact info

    Medical records

    National ID / NIN

    IP addresses (if linked to a person)

Instead, they should refer to:

    Anonymized IDs

    Client Codes

    Hashed tokens

‚úÖ Example
‚ùå Not compliant (in finance_report.txt):

Client: Jane Adaobi
Phone: 0803-456-7890
Amount Paid: ‚Ç¶1,200,000

‚úÖ Compliant version:

Client ID: C0142
Amount Paid: ‚Ç¶1,200,000

Then C0142 would map to Jane Adaobi in a separate encrypted file or database, like client_registry.enc.
üõ°Ô∏è Best practices for saving PII:
Method	Description	Example
Encryption	Store names, emails, etc. using encryption	client_registry.enc
Access control	Only authorized roles can access sensitive files	Role-based login
Separate storage	Separate PII from transaction logs or financial summaries	Keep ID mappings in another location
Audit trails	Log every access to PII	System logs or DLP
üìö Regulatory Framework Highlights
Framework	Key PII Safeguards
NDPR (Nigeria)	PII should only be used for clear purposes, with consent; must be protected from unauthorized access
GDPR (EU)	Pseudonymization, data minimization, and clear lawful basis for use are mandatory
HIPAA (US)	Only authorized use of protected health info (PHI); encryption and access logging are mandatory
NIST (US standard)	Encourages best security controls like access control, monitoring, incident response

If you‚Äôd like, I can also help generate:

    A proper template directory structure for such documents.

Summary (TL;DR)
Task	What You Should Do
Reports like finance_report.txt	Never include full names or phone numbers. Use Client ID instead.
Where to keep real names & contact info	In an encrypted file or database, e.g., client_registry.enc
Who should access PII	Only authorized staff like DPO, HR, or system admin
How to secure PII	Encrypt files, limit access, maintain logs, get consent
Where consent lives	In a separate, signed file (consents/consent_form_xx.pdf)
