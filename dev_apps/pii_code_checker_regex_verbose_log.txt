pii_code_checker_regex_verbose_log.py is a source code analysis tool 
It is a slower but deeper-search version of selective_pii_code_checker.py
because it is intentionally designed to do a longer but thorough search of all files in its way to scan,
with verbose, it works similarly by scanning local script files (e.g., .py, .js, .php, etc.) for patterns that may leak
 Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as unmasked names, emails, phone numbers,
 or poor handling of data storage, logging, or API requests.

For more on this scripts' common-behaviour, please see selective_pii_code_checker.txt
