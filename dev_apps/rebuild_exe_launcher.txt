Here's a friendly rebuild helper script â€” a small .py file you can double-click anytime youâ€™ve updated your Python codes
 and want to rebuild your .exe file using PyInstaller. Saved as:rebuild_exe_launcher.py
What This Script Does:

    Opens a window with a button.

    When you click it, it asks you to select a .py file.

    It then asks if you want to rebuild it.

    If you click Yes, it runs pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py.

    Your new .exe will show up in the dist folder automatically.

ðŸ§¾ How to Use:

    Make sure PyInstaller is installed:

    pip install pyinstaller

    Double-click the rebuild_exe_launcher.py file.

    Select your .py file (the one youâ€™ve updated).

    Let the miracle happen! âœ¨

ðŸš€ Bonus Tip:

You can convert this launcher itself to .exe using:

pyinstaller --onefile rebuild_exe_launcher.py

Then, next time, you donâ€™t need Python at all â€” just click rebuild_exe_launcher.exe and rebuild any .py to .exe with ease.
