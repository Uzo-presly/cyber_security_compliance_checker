This script is an expensive Improvement on the alraedy existing cyber_audit_files_for_regulators.py as you need to be on-line for it.

 Explanation: Adding Intelligence to cyber_audit_files_for_regulators.py
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Your audit script currently checks for exact keywords. This is powerful but limited:
#
# a. Categorizing Keywords:
#    Instead of treating "name" and "password" the same, you could tag them:
#      - PII: name, phone, address
#      - Secrets: password, api_key, token
#      - Compliance risk: login_url, redirect, consent


# b. Use AI/LLM:
#    Instead of only finding the word "password", AI can analyze context:
#      → e.g., detect emails that violate consent, or where patient info is overly exposed.
#    You could send chunks of a document to a language model (like me) to ask:
#      "Does this violate GDPR?"
#
#    That is 'adding intelligence'. It transforms static keyword scan into dynamic context-aware analysis.

This script requires `openai` library. Install with: pip install openai

you expected to Store your key in a .env file as OPENAI_API_KEY

inside the script for model="gpt-4",  # Use gpt-3.5-turbo if gpt-4 is unavailable

and for test_file = "finance_report.txt"  # Ensure this file exists in the same directory (i.e the same folder with this python script)

🔍 What We've Just Accomplished
🔹 Purpose:

This script enhances your original cyber_audit_runner.py by allowing you to analyze the contents of sensitive files using AI, especially for regulatory violations like:

    📞 PII (e.g. names, phone numbers)

    🏥 Medical record leakage (HIPAA)

    🔐 Passwords or credentials

    📝 Lack of documented user consent

🔹 Improvements Over Original Script:
Feature	Original				cyber_audit_files_for_regulators.py	Enhanced AI Tool

Regex-based detection						✅ Yes			✅ Yes (if integrated manually)

Understands context (e.g., is the PII expected or not?)		❌ No			✅ Yes – via AI

Categorizes findings (PII, HIPAA, GDPR)				❌ No			✅ Yes

Explains why something is risky					❌ No			✅ Yes

Customizable with prompts					❌ No			✅ Yes (via GPT prompt)

▶️ How to Use
🧰 Requirements:

    Install required libraries:

pip install openai python-dotenv

    Create a .env file in the same folder and add:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here

    Save your document (e.g. finance_report.txt) in the same directory.

🚀 Run the Script:

python cyber_audit_files_for_regulators.py

✅ Sample Output from AI (if finance_report.txt has violations):

========== AI-Based Audit Results ==========
Flagged Issues:
1. Full name and phone number found without context of consent. [PII Exposure]
2. Medical record number revealed inline with transaction history. [HIPAA Violation]
3. No mention of user consent for storing personal information. [Lack of Consent]
