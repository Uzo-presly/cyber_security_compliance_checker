We use Python’s built-in tkinter module to:

    Create a window (Tk)

    Add a Text widget to display output

    Optionally, add scrollbars and a “Refresh” button

We use:

    pwd.getpwall() to fetch all users (Linux/macOS), or

    subprocess.getoutput('net user') for Windows

Run the script

python3 list_users_gui.py

or on Windows:

python list_users_gui.py

Result:

A GUI window pops up showing current user accounts on your PC!


To find which Python script checks user accounts, run this from your terminal (assuming your project folder is dev_app or similar):

cd ~~/protectedVault/mountpoint/cyber_security_compliance_checker/dev_apps$  # ← Adjust this path as needed
grep -i -r "user" *.py

Explanation:

    grep -i → case-insensitive search

    -r → recursive through subfolders

    "user" → keyword likely in a user-check script

    *.py → limits to Python files

You can also try more precise keywords:

grep -r -E "getpwnam|getpwuid|/etc/passwd|net user" *.py

    This will help identify any script using methods or files related to user account listing.
